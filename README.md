# System Identification - Practice Exercises

Welcome to the System Identification Practice Exercise Repository!

This collection offers a comprehensive set of exercises designed to help you prepare for the System Identification exam. The exercises have been carefully crafted based on:
- Previous exam questions 
- In-class examples and problems
- Core concepts covered throughout the course
- Real-world system identification scenarios

While these exercises serve as a valuable study tool, they should be considered as part of a broader preparation strategy that includes:
- Understanding theoretical foundations
- Working through course materials
- Practicing implementation techniques
- Developing intuition for method selection

## Important Notes
- These exercises are meant to complement, not replace, your regular course study materials
- Solutions are provided but try to solve the problems independently first
- Focus on understanding the reasoning behind each approach rather than just memorizing solutions
- Pay special attention to the practical aspects and tradeoffs of different methods

## Using These Exercises
1. Start with basic concepts and gradually move to more complex problems
2. Try to explain your reasoning for each step
3. Compare your solutions with the provided ones
4. Identify areas where you need additional practice

Remember: Success in the exam comes from a deep understanding of the material rather than just practicing exercises. Use these problems as a way to test and reinforce your knowledge while identifying areas that need more focus.

Good luck with your preparation!
